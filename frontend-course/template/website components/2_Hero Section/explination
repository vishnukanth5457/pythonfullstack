## 🧩 HERO SECTION STRUCTURE

```
Hero Section
├── Headline (Main Message)
├── Subheading (Support Message)
├── CTA Buttons
└── Visual (Image / Slider / Video)
```

---

## 🅰️ Headline (Main Message)

### ✔️ Purpose

* Strong, clear, benefit-driven
* NOT long
* NOT technical jargon

### ✔️ Best Practice

* 6–12 words
* One clear value

### ✅ Good Examples

```
Build Skills That Get You Hired
Design. Develop. Deploy Faster.
Learn Industry-Ready Tech Skills
```

📌 **Analogy**
Headline = **movie title**, not the full story.

---

## 🅱️ Subheading (Supporting Message)

### ✔️ Purpose

* Explain the headline in 1 line
* Add clarity & trust

### ✅ Good Example

```
Learn web development, VLSI, and software skills with real projects and expert guidance.

### ✔️ Best CTA Structure

### ✅ Examples

| Primary CTA | Secondary CTA |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Get Started | View Courses  |
| Enroll Now  | Watch Demo    |

## 🅳 Hero Visual (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

### ❓ Image vs Slider vs Video — Which is BEST?

Let’s be honest 👇

---

### 🥇 BEST OVERALL: **Hero Image (or Illustration)** ✅

✔ Fast loading
✔ SEO-friendly
✔ Works on all devices
✔ Easy to maintain

**Use when:**

* Portfolio
* EdTech
* Corporate
* Startup websites

📌 **Recommendation:**
👉 **1 strong image + text = best conversion**

---

### 🥈 SLIDER (Use Carefully ⚠️)

✔ Shows multiple messages
❌ Users ignore slides after first
❌ Slower UX

**Use only if:**

* Marketing banners
* E-commerce offers

📌 **Interview Answer**

> “Sliders often reduce clarity and engagement if overused.”

---

### 🥉 VIDEO BACKGROUND (Premium but risky)

✔ High impact
❌ Heavy loading
❌ Bad on slow networks
❌ SEO issues

**Use only if:**

* Brand storytelling
* Landing pages
* Short looping video (5–8s)

📌 If used → **mute + loop + fallback image**

---

## 🏆 FINAL VERDICT (BEST ONE)

### ✅ BEST HERO SECTION =

```
Text Content (Left)
+ Strong Image / Illustration (Right)
+ Clear CTA Buttons
```

This is what **Apple, Google, Udemy-style sites** follow.
